VSec launched a few months ago and already we have rocketed to over 300 active users. 🎉  

This is the signs that we are beginning to build a community!   
But a community is only a community when it is being nurtured and enabled to become a tool for connecting people.

Over the last few years I have been giving various talks and lectures at different education houses around Denmark.
I would now like to bring some of these subjects into VSec and run a series of lectures on a regular basis throughout 2021.  

The series of lectures will be called **VSec presents: "David and friends"**, where I and some of my friends from around the cyber security community in Denmark will run workshops and lectures for around 1 or 2 hours every 2nd week in the evening after the kids have gone to bed.
The first few subjects will be focusing on the basic building blocks of Cyber Threat Intelligence with us slowly progressing into other areas, possibly Incident Response depending on what the feedback from the community is.   

I hope you can find the time to join us for some of these sessions, I promise to make them fun and give you hands on experience within tools that can be used to enhance your daily work. Tools like Obsidian.md and various others!
We will make sure that the sessions are recorded in case you are unable to make it and then reshared on the [VSec YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGQCK473y181BjNMJLrW11g).
The sessions will start on August 5th and continue every 2nd week throughout 2021. With respect of family situation etc, the date may be subject to change but this will be communicated with good notice through the VSec Discord and on the [event calendar](https://vsec.dk/events/)!
